Sebelius that the ACA individual mandate was constitutional under the Taxing and Spending Clause and thus that the tax penalty was not unconstitutionally coercive.

If congress wanted to repeal the ACA entirely, it should have done so, rather than zeroing the tax penalty and hoping that the courts would finish the job for them.",
