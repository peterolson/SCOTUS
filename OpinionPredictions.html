            peterJustification: `The goal of the Armed Career Criminal Act seems to be to increase the severity of punishments for criminals who have demonstrated a history of violent crime and thus pose a greater threat to society.
            Reckless violent crimes pose the same threat to society as non-reckless violent crimes, and it seems to be within the government's interest to include them under the ACCA.<br>
            Including reckless crimes does not seem to be a big threat to the rule of lenity, since invoking the ACCA requires three prior violent crimes on top of illegally possessing a firearm as a felon.`,

            it is reasonable to require a judge imposing such a sentence to explicitly justify why they found the defendant to be permanently incorrigible, and seems to be required by Miller v. Alabama and Montgomery v. Louisiana precedent.`,

Also, during the argument, he seemed to cast doubt on the validity of the case because it is "light years away" from the original intent of the Eigth Amendment and indicated that whether or not someone is capable of redemption was more of a philosophical question than a legal question.` },
                { text: `Kavanaugh will rule for Mississippi because in the oral argument he indicated that any judge who sentences a juvenile to life imprisonment would most likely have considered whether or not they were permanently incorrigible, and judges are usually presumed to be aware of the law and to have weighed all of the relevant factors even if they don't explicitly mention it in their ruling.` },
